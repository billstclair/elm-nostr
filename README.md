[billstclair/elm-bluesky](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/billstclair/elm-bluesky/latest) is an Elm client for the [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/) social-networking system. The BlueSky API is documented at [docs.bsky.app/docs/category/http-reference](ohttps://docs.bsky.app/docs/category/http-reference).

This library is designed to match `billstclair/elm-mastodon`, as much as makes sense.

`elm-test` tests the encoders and decoders for the `Entities`.

The example, a low-level API explorer webapp, is live (for the Mastodon client API) at [mammudeck.com/api](https://mammudeck.com/api/).
