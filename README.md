[billstclair/elm-nostr](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/billstclair/elm-nostr/latest) is an Elm client for the [Nostr](https://nostr.com/) social-networking system. The Nostr API is documented at [https://nips.nostr.com/1](https://nips.nostr.com/1).

This library is designed to match `billstclair/elm-mastodon`, as much as makes sense.

`elm-test` tests the encoders and decoders for the `Entities`.

The example, a low-level API explorer webapp, is live (for the Mastodon client API) at [mammudeck.com/api](https://mammudeck.com/api/).
